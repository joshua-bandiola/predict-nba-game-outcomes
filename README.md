# Predicting NBA Game Outcomes

## Description
This project addresses a binary classification problem, aiming to predict NBA game outcomes by applying 
suitable machine learning models. The analysis exclusively uses the 2021 NBA schedule dataset, 
without incorporating player-specific statistics. To improve prediction accuracy, 
various data mining techniques are employed, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, 
and hyperparameter tuning. Several classifiers were trained and tested using cross-validation, 
including Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors. 
Logistic Regression performed best, achieving an accuracy of 63%, 
and was further used to predict outcomes for the 2022 season, obtaining a 61% accuracy rate. 

The rationale for this analysis is that by focusing on non player-specific data allows this research to highlight how 
variables other than individual skill have an impact on games. It is also interesting how teamâ€™s winning or losing their 
previous games have an impact on their winning percentage.
